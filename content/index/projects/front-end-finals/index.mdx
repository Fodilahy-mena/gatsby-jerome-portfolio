This landing page was our final project in the front-end course which is built with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> including <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">SASS</abbr> and some basic JavaScript with scrolling images.
In this project, I did the best I could to make the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> accessible, well structured and valid, and with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> styling, I followed the given design and made it responsive.

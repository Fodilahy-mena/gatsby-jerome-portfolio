This landing page was our final project in the front-end course. It was built with HTML, CSS, SASS and some vanilla JavaScript for scrolling images.

In this project, I did the best I could to make the HTML accessible, well structured and valid. In terms of styling, I followed a Figma design and made it responsive.

In this project, I worked with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript to create a birthday app. The main purpose of this project was to implement CRUD operations.

You can sort people according to the most recent birthdays and filter them by name.

In this project, I worked with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and Javascript to create a birthday app. The main purpose of this project was to create a simple <abbr title="Create Read Update Delete">CRUD</abbr> App.

We can sort people list according to whose birthday is the soonest, also we can filter them by name.

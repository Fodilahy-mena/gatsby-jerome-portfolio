import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I'm 21 years old. I come from a small town called Andovolalina which is located in the west of Mahanoro, Madagascar.

I have spent two incredible years learning at <a class="onja" href="https://onja.org/">onja</a> - a non-profit organisation (a social enterprise) in Madagascar, a year of being able to speak English and a year of coding.

Being an old hand at <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript including React was the main goal during the last one year.

Now, applying those skills in real world is my gratefulness and delight.

I'm Jerome Emilien, a web developer focusing on front-end development based in Madagascar.

I have spent three incredible years learning at <a class="onja" href="https://onja.org/">Onja Madagascar</a>, being able to speak English in a year and the rest was spent on learning coding.

Being an old hand at <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, Javascript and React JS including React Native was the main goal during the last one year.

Now, applying those skills in the real world is my desire and delight.

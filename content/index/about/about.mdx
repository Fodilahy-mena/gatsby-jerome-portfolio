I'm Jerome Emilien, a web developer from Madagascar focusing on front-end development.

I have spent three incredible years learning at <a class="onja" href="https://onja.org/">Onja Madagascar</a>, spending the first year on English and the rest was spent on learning to code.

Being an old hand at <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, Javascript and React JS including React Native was the main goal during the last year.

I now really look forward to applying those skills in the real world and making a difference to othersâ€™ lives through code.
